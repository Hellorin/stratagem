{"name":"Stratagem","tagline":"Stratagem - DD- and rewriting strategies- based model checker","body":"Description\r\n===========\r\n\r\nStrataGEM (Strategy Generic Extensible Modelchecker) is a tool aimed at the analysis of Petri nets and other models of concurrency by means of symbolic model-checking techniques. StrataGEM marries the well know concepts of Term Rewriting (TR) to the efficiency of Decision Diagrams (DDs). TR systems are a great way to describe the semantics of a system, being readable and compact, but their direct implementation tends to be rather slow on large sets of terms. On the other hand, DDs have demonstrated their efficiency for model-checking, but translating a system semantics into efficient DDs operations is an expertâ€™s matter. StrataGEM describes the semantics of a system in terms of strategies over a TR system, and automatically translates these rules into operations on DD to handle the model-checking. The ultimate goal of StrataGEM is to become a verification framework for the different variants of Petri nets by separating the semantics of the model from the computation that performs model-checking.\r\n\r\nBinary distribution\r\n===================\r\n\r\nYou can download the binaries from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/stratagem-mc/).\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n\r\nStratagem v0.3 can perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\n- Read a Place/Transition Petri net and calculate its state space.\r\n- Automatically decompose a P/T Petri net in modules\r\n- Transform a P/T Petri net into a rewriting based transition system\r\n- Use different strategies to speed up the calculation of the state space. In particular it can use anonymization and saturation.\r\n- Read a clustering file to optimize the state space generation.\r\n\r\nInput formats\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThe following input formats are supported:\r\n\r\n- [PNML](http://www.pnml.org) for P/T nets\r\n- DiViNe. In the current version the divine formalism can only be used via API.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\n\r\nTo run stratagem you need:\r\n\r\n- Java 1.6 or later\r\n\r\nTo compile stratagem you need:\r\n\r\n- sbt 0.13\r\n- Java 1.6 or later\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\n\r\nScalaDoc is available [here](http://alpina.unige.ch/jenkins/job/stratagem/javadoc/?#package).\r\n\r\nstratagem\r\n=========\r\n\r\nStratagem - DD- and rewriting strategies- based model checker\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
